# Codex Entry Prompt â€” Standalone NinjaScript Strategy (PER-ACCOUNT HWM REQUIRED)

**You must honor these files in this repo:**
- `/POLICY.md` (hard compile rules)
- `/MODEL_CONTRACT.md` (do-not-break contract)
- `/templates/StrategyTemplate.cs.txt` (copy this and only edit inside ENTRY markers)

**Do not** modify DIAGNOSTICS or RTM immutable blocks. **PER-ACCOUNT ONLY** for HWM/BREACH persistence.

My SPEC (entry logic only):
- [Describe the entry conditions and filters here]

Deliverable:
- A single compilable `.cs` file named `<StrategyName>.cs` with class in the configured namespace, editing only the ENTRY region.
