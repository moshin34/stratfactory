# LEARNING â€” Compile Error Loop

1) Compile in NinjaTrader 8.
2) If errors occur, copy the entire compiler output into knowledge/errors.log (append).
3) Open prompts/codex_fix_prompt.md and paste:
   - The current .cs (full text)
   - The error text
   - Optionally a few bullets from known_fixes.md
4) Submit to Codex, replace file, compile again.

Over time, errors.log + known_fixes.md become a memory bank to reduce repeat issues.
